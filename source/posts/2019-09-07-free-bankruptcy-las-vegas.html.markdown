There is no denying it that bankruptcy is a crucial debt relief tool for those in critical financial situations such as loss of a job, getting divorced or getting injured. The truth is, not all bankruptcy lawyers you see out there know how to get you out of this situation as many of them have little knowledge about how to get this done quickly without hassles.

In a situation when you also find an excellent lawyer to help in the process, being a low-income Las Vegas resident will surely have its tolls on you as the costs of hiring such a lawyer could go as high as \$1,500. So what do you do? Do not fret! There is still a way to handle this situation before it gets out of hand as this is a difficult thing to experience.

Having to be faced with foreclosure as a homeowner is such a nightmare nobody will like to experience, so declaring yourself bankrupt will go a long way to tackle these financial setbacks. But filing for bankruptcy is another challenge on its own and care must be taken when doing this, else you may end up wasting valuable time and still get foreclosed on. The following tips listed below will help you when filling for a free bankruptcy in Las Vegas.

## Collect Your Documents:

First thing first, make sure you gather all your financial documents as this will help you to have the full picture what your current finances are. Go for your credit report and check it very well. Debts such as personal loans and medical bills may not be on the credit report, and so, it is essential you list out the missing ones and take note.

## Go for Credit Counseling:

This is one of the most critical steps you have got to take during these trying times. Filling for bankruptcy demands that you take a credit counseling course. Attending this course makes it more apparent to you how to go about the repayment plan and how best to get back on your feet.

## Completing the Bankruptcy Form:
