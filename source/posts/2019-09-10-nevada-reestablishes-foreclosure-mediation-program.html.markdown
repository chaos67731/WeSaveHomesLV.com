excerpt: "The truth is, everyone knows how hard and challenging it is to fall behind in making the
mortgage payments. It inspires fear that could disorganize a homeowner, but you must
be strong and focus when dealing with this issue."

## Foreclosure Mediation Program

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People that have got a Notice of Default or Complaint for Judicial Foreclosure on an owner-occupied private home in NV need to now file a request in District Court to participate in Mediation. For a better idea of the Foreclosure Program, please reference and review&nbsp;</span><a class="" href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB490_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senate Bill 490</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;and the</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></strong><a class="" href="https://nvcourts.gov/Supreme/Rules/Amendments/Foreclosure_Mediation_Rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevada Supreme Court Foreclosure ADKT 435</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Exhibit A and Exhibit B, Request for Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Form.</span></p>

Following Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules, the restricted grantor or person of the title of the owner-occupied residence may participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program:

- In the direction of a housing advocate.
- In obtaining a Declaration of Default and Election to Sell.
- In the assistance of Complaint about Judicial Foreclosure.
- In a mutual understanding among parties.
  The grantor or person who holds the title of the record may file a Petition for Foreclosure Mediation in District Court if they desire to compete.

With the end of the FMP, homeowners are missing their most reliable, low-cost alternative for mediation. Here are two examples of what foreclosure looks like with and without the FMP’s guidance. Plainly set, if the bank is foreclosing and you need them to prove they have the right to do so, there are only two opportunities:

- 1: FMP: The homeowner is granted the opportunity to have a low-cost foreclosure mediation that may result in saving the home.

- 2: “Homeowners Bill of Rights (HOBOR)” lawsuit

## Can I apply to the FMP if I haven't received a notice of default?

If your house is underwater, your payments are past due or you have any other reason to believe that your home may be in danger, you do not have to wait for the Notice Of Disagreement (NOD) to be issued. The law gives a way for homeowners to opt into the business if they feel they cannot provide their mortgage payment.
