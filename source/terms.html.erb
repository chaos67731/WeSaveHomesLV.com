            Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and
            Conditions") carefully before using the <%= data.site.site_url %>
            website (the "Service") operated by <%= data.site.site_name %> ("us",
            "we", or "our").
          </p>

          <p>
            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your
            acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to
            all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
            Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not
            access the Service. The Terms and Conditions agreement for <%= data.site.site_name %>
            has been created with the help of
            <a href="https://termsfeed.com/">TermsFeed</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>

          <p>
            Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services
            that are not owned or controlled by <%= data.site.site_name %>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <%= data.site.site_name %> has no control over, and assumes no
            responsibility for, the content, Contact policies, or practices of
            any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
            agree that <%= data.site.site_name %> shall not be responsible or liable,
            directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to
            be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such
            content, goods or services available on or through any such web
            sites or services.
          </p>

          <p>
            We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and Contact
            policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.
          </p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>

          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately,
            without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive
            termination shall survive termination, including, without
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
            and limitations of liability.
          </p>

          <h2>Governing Law</h2>

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of Idaho, United States, without regard to its conflict of law
            provisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
            Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
            have between us regarding the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes</h2>

          <p>
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
            these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to
            provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion.
          </p>

          <p>
            By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you
            do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
